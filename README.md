1. Put imu .mat file into folder .\imu  
   Put vicon .mat file into folder .\vicon  
   Put camera .mat file into folder .\cam  
   All these sensor data are from quadrotor running  
2. Modify state_estimation.py, change flags, dataset index and mat file location accordingly  
3. The result will present at folder .\result. There will be an orientation plot that compare UKF estimate and Vicon ground truth.
   Based on the estimate, a panorama video that stitches images to a sphere surrounding the global camera will be displayed.
